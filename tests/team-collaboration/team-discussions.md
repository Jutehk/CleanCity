## 🌟 Overview of Collaboration

As Team ESPADA, we held dedicated meetings at the end of each project phase to check on progress, confirm completed tasks, identify blockers, and decide if any adjustments were needed. These meetings helped us stay aligned and ensure that everyone understood their roles clearly.

We used:

- **Zoom** for official team check-ins and decision-making.
- **WhatsApp** for real-time communication and follow-ups.
- **GitHub Projects** for assigning tasks, closing issues, and commenting on progress.

We also used the weekly sessions to support each other, troubleshoot problems (like tool usage or test setup), and share lessons learned during testing.
